# lephare example notebooks
This repository contains a number of example notebooks designed to teach users how to use LePHARE. They have been designed as an acompaniment to the course on photometric redshifts delivered at [The GDR school organised in Marseille, France on 3 and 4 November 2025](https://indico.iap.fr/event/48/).

They should be read alongside the main [documentation for lePHARE](https://lephare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
